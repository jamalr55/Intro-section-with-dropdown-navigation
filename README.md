### Useful resources

- [w3school.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This site helped me with HTML & CSS.
- [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
